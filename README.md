# The Dala Wallet
The Dala Wallet is composed of a number of components to facilitate external transfers in and speedy internal transactions. The functionality of Dala is exposed through a RESTful interface hosted on AWS. All APIs reside behind µRaiden paywall proxies; these payments are all denominated in DALA and are paid for by the caller.

The [Dala Wallet JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/getdala/dala-wallet-js) makes it simple to interact with the Dala ecosystem either by providing your own Web3 instance (for example, from MetaMask) or by providing the sender details (address and private key).
